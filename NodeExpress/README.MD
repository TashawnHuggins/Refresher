Using JS and NodeExpress (https://expressjs.com/) build a server that has at least 4 working endpoints that all do different things (at least one endpoint should take in input from the client) AND the server will dish at least 2 different html pages.


Explanation:
We can hard code a list originally
For endpoints:
1)	Ex: adding a pet
2)	Ex: deleting a pet 
3)	Ex: taking input from user
